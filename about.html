            <p class="copy">We’re a highly passionate, group of Toronto-based designers and builders who create
                inspiring spaces.
                Nothing gets us more excited than helping our clients transform an interior or exterior area into
                something beautiful, functional and unique to them.</p>
            <p class="copy">We’ll offer our counsel, of course, but your vision is our goal. You can see it in all our
                work, which
                marries the beauty of natural materials with the aesthetics of industrial design.</p>
            <p class="copy">Unlike the traditional approach to construction projects, where a designer hands off to a
                contractor, we
                follow the design-build model that integrates the two disciplines. The result is a seamless flow from
                imagination to proposal to creation. Our process offers you a single point of responsibility, so you can
                be assured of the highest aesthetic standards while simultaneously reducing practical risk and overall
                costs.</p>

            <p class="copy">For over ten years, we’ve worked together, both as friends and as creators—Jason as an
                architect-designer
                and Scott as a builder-contractor. In 2019, we formalized what began years ago as a side-project
                together, and created a thriving design-build practice that lets us bring our individual gifts to each
                project we take on.</p>

                Where other kids admired superheroes in capes, Jason’s heroes used mechanical pencils and graph paper.
                On
                his way to fulfilling his childhood ambition, he got his undergraduate degree in architecture from
                Ryerson University, and then went on to complete a master’s in architecture at the University of
                Toronto. Since then, he’s gained valuable experience, dedicating the past 15 years to honing his craft
                and in so doing has re-imagined spaces everywhere from healthcare facilities and other commercial
                buildings to residential properties.</p>

                Scott grew up the son and grandson of do-it-yourselfer-contractors, and comes by his love for building
                honestly. Whether around his own home or helping friends around theirs, he’s always liked taking things
                apart, figuring out how they work and re-building them. This naturally led to a career in television
                post-production, where he learned workflow analysis and project management. He puts these organizational
                skills to good use, along with his knowledge of product design, working with Jason. Together, they help
                clients find the right solution to achieve project goals, by reinventing incredible new spaces.</p>
